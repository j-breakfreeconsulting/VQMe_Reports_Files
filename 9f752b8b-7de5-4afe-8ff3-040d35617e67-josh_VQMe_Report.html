      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You know the frustration of doing solid work but watching others get the credit. You deliver results, you show up consistently, you do what needs to be done—but when it comes to recognition, respect, and visibility, you're still waiting in the wings.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Have you tried speaking up more in meetings but felt like your contributions got overlooked? Have you tried networking events and industry functions but left feeling disconnected from the people who could actually advance your career? Have you tried documenting your wins and presenting them to leadership but felt like you were bragging or being pushy?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have one incredible cognitive asset at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage & Conviction (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you're operating from this strength, you're steadfast, committed, and accountable. You naturally stay true to your values while remaining genuinely open to other perspectives. You have the rare ability to stand up for your ideas while also being willing to change when presented with better information.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        But something's blocking access to this strength when it comes to getting the recognition you deserve in your career.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeing Value in All You Do (10-)</strong>, which means you consistently underestimate the importance and impact of your contributions. You see your work as "just what you have to do" rather than recognizing the genuine value you create.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>. These create a pattern where you don't fully recognize your own worth, you judge yourself too harshly, and you underestimate the difference you make. You may even feel it's "selfish" or "arrogant" to highlight your achievements.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Add <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Respecting Systems & Authority (17-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (24-)</strong>, and you resist the very organizational systems and relationship-building approaches that could increase your visibility.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? You do excellent work in isolation, avoid the "politics" that feel inauthentic to you, and wonder why others who seem less capable are getting ahead.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Dissonance:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You have perfect clarity on being true to your principles while staying open to growth and feedback, but your biases convince you that your work should speak for itself and that actively seeking recognition somehow compromises your integrity.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to help you maintain focus on results rather than politics, and to avoid appearing self-promoting or arrogant. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> the kind of professional who naturally receives the recognition and respect they deserve, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Why Changing Your Actions Hasn't Worked - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You already know what you "should" do to increase your visibility. But you don't do it consistently. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Most people trying to build recognition focus on changing their actions—speaking up more, networking harder, self-promoting better. But you can't sustain new actions without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current behavior.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When a meeting ends and you realize you should have shared your perspective on the key decision, your brain immediately thinks: "I don't want to seem like I'm just talking to hear myself talk" or "My contribution probably isn't that valuable anyway."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That thought creates emotions of hesitation and self-doubt.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Those emotions drive actions like staying quiet, downplaying your expertise, or avoiding opportunities to showcase your work.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? Another missed opportunity to demonstrate your value, and the cycle of being overlooked continues.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible asset for having authentic conversations about your contributions while staying true to your values.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Every time you minimize your contributions or avoid opportunities to increase your visibility, you're not just missing career advancement. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of professional whose work goes unnoticed."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The friction isn't about your capability or the quality of your work—it's about trying to build recognition through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeing Value in All You Do (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strength (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage & Conviction (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your cognitive asset gives you the capacity to authentically advocate for your work while maintaining your integrity. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with opportunities to increase your visibility throughout your day.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your asset before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a professional who's "trying to get noticed" and become a professional who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> demonstrates their value with confidence and authenticity.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Career advancement stops feeling like self-promotion or office politics and starts feeling like authentic contribution. The internal tension between wanting recognition and feeling like you shouldn't have to ask for it? It dissolves—not because circumstances changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You become the kind of professional who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> respect and visibility through aligned action instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">hoping</strong> others will notice your work.
      </p>
