      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You know the frustration of doing solid work but watching others get the credit, the visibility, the respect you know you deserve. You're capable, you deliver results, you have strong convictions—but recognition feels like it's always just out of reach.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you're operating from these strengths, you're the kind of person others naturally respect. You can stand firm in your principles without being judgmental, hold people accountable while remaining fair and understanding. You have the capacity to be both steadfast and open—exactly the combination that builds lasting professional reputation.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        But something's blocking access to these strengths when it comes to building the reputation you want.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, which means you're extremely resistant to anything that feels like control or coercion. You think there's no one right way to do things, except perhaps yours.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Caring About Others (24-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong>. These create a pattern where you prefer not to get too involved with people and don't fully recognize your own value.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Add <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Respecting Systems &amp; Authority (17-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>, and what emerges is someone who operates independently, avoids the relationship-building that creates visibility, and doesn't believe what they do makes much difference anyway.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? You stay focused on delivering results—which you do well—but you're not engaging in the very activities that build reputation: seeking input, building alliances, promoting your contributions, or connecting with the people who could recognize and amplify your work.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Dissonance:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You have perfect clarity on how to balance courage with openness and accountability with compassion—the exact qualities that create professional respect. But your biases convince you that seeking recognition is somehow beneath you, that building relationships is unnecessary, and that your work should speak for itself.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to help you maintain independence and avoid the politics or relationship dynamics that felt threatening or manipulative. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> someone whose reputation reflects their actual contributions, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Why Trying Harder to Get Recognized Hasn't Worked - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        This framework explains why your efforts to build reputation haven't resolved the underlying tension:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        <strong style="font-weight: 600;">Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your thoughts create emotion (energy in motion). That emotion provides the energy to take action, which leads to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When most people try to change their results, they focus on changing their actions. But you can't sustain new actions without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current behavior.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You already know what you should do to build reputation. But you don't do it. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That feeling—that emotion—is the step most people skip. They jump straight from knowing what to do to trying to force the action, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain it.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        So you try to force yourself to network, promote your work, seek feedback. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your body is in one place while your head and your heart feel like they're in another. Ever felt that disconnect?
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center; margin: 24px 0;">

             width="350" 
             style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you complete a significant project, your brain immediately thinks: "My work should speak for itself. I shouldn't have to sell or promote what I've accomplished."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That thought creates emotions of resistance and mild disdain for the "politics" of visibility.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Those emotions drive actions like focusing immediately on the next task, avoiding conversations about your contributions, and staying heads-down rather than engaging with stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? Another solid deliverable that gets absorbed into the organization without building your reputation.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for balancing conviction with openness—exactly what would make relationship-building feel authentic rather than manipulative.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Every time you deliver excellent work without engaging in the visibility that creates recognition, you're not just missing opportunities. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of person whose contributions go unnoticed."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The friction isn't about your competence or the quality of your work—it's about trying to build reputation through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Caring About Others (24-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to change your thoughts at the source. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with opportunities to promote your work, seek feedback, or build the relationships that amplify reputation throughout your day.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being someone who's "trying to get noticed" and become someone who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> builds reputation through authentic relationship and contribution.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Building reputation stops feeling like self-promotion and starts feeling like genuine connection. The resistance you've felt toward visibility activities? It dissolves—not because the activities changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You become the kind of professional who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> recognition through principled leadership instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">hoping</strong> others will eventually notice your work.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Where this leaves you
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        At this point, you've seen how certain thinking patterns tend to shape the emotions and actions that lead to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That awareness gives you more options than you had before.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The question now is applying this pattern recognition when reputation-building opportunities actually arise.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">

        This is where you move from understanding your cognitive patterns to recognizing them in real situations and practicing the shift from biases to assets when it actually matters—like when you're deciding whether to speak up in a meeting, share a success, or build a key relationship.
