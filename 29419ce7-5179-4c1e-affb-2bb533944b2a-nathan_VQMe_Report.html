      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      You see it happening. You know you have the leadership qualities to advance—your moral compass is solid, you're fair with people, you can balance compassion with accountability. But when it comes to actually positioning yourself for advancement, learning new competencies, or stepping into bigger leadership roles, something keeps holding you back.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      You know what needs to happen with your career development. The problem isn't knowledge—it's that something in your thinking is working against you.
      </p>

      The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      When you're operating from these strengths, you're the leader people trust. You stay true to your values even when it's difficult. You can hold people accountable while still being fair and understanding. You naturally balance "tough love" with flexibility—exactly what organizations need in their leaders.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      But something's blocking access to these strengths when it comes to advancing your career.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
      The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, which means you're extremely resistant to being controlled, taking direction, or being told what to do. Your mind tells you that other people's attempts to influence you limit your options and power.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment (10-)</strong>—you feel like you're not living up to your potential, like something's missing, but you feel trapped by current obligations and expectations.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Add <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong>, and you have a pattern where you don't fully recognize your own value, you question whether what you do really matters, and you judge yourself too harshly.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      The result? You stay in your current role—competent, reliable, doing good work—but not actively pursuing advancement opportunities that would require you to seek input from others, promote your value, or step into spaces where you might be evaluated or directed.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
      The Dissonance:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      You have perfect clarity on standing up for your values and balancing compassion with accountability, but your biases convince you that seeking advancement means letting others control you, that you don't deserve it, and that what you contribute doesn't really matter anyway.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to help you maintain independence and avoid disappointment in situations where advancement felt risky or uncertain. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> the kind of leader who naturally advances and develops new competencies, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
      Why Changing Your Actions Hasn't Worked - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Most career development advice focuses on actions: "Network more," "Speak up in meetings," "Ask for feedback," "Volunteer for stretch assignments." But you can't sustain new actions without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current behavior.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      You already know what you should do. But you don't do it consistently. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      That feeling—that emotion—is the step most people skip in career development. They jump straight from knowing what to do to trying to force the action, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain it.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
      Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Your thoughts create emotion (energy in motion). That emotion provides the energy to take action, which leads to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      So you try to force yourself. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your body is in one place while your head and your heart feel like they're in another. Ever felt that disconnect?
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
      Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      When you see an advancement opportunity or leadership development program, your brain immediately thinks: "They're just going to try to control me and tell me what to do. I already know what I'm doing."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      That thought creates emotions of resistance and frustration.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Those emotions drive actions like avoiding the opportunity, not applying, or participating halfheartedly.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      The result? You stay where you are, reinforcing the story that advancement isn't really for you or that the organization doesn't see your value.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for building the relationships and seeking the input that actually accelerate leadership development.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
      The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Every time you avoid advancement opportunities because they feel controlling, you're not just missing career growth. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of person who stays in my lane because stepping up means compromising my independence."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Every time you dismiss the value of what you contribute, you're not just being humble. You're training yourself to be invisible in the very moments when visibility would serve your career.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      The friction isn't about your leadership ability—it's about trying to advance your career through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to change your thoughts at the source. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with advancement decisions throughout your career.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
      What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a leader who's "trying to advance" and become a leader who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> pursues growth opportunities.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      Career development stops feeling like playing politics or compromising your independence and starts feeling like the natural expression of your values and capabilities. The resistance to feedback and development opportunities? It dissolves—not because the opportunities changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      You become the kind of leader who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> advancement opportunities through authentic relationship-building instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">avoiding</strong> them out of fear of being controlled.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
      Where this leaves you
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      At this point, you've seen how certain thinking patterns tend to shape the emotions and actions that lead to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
      That awareness gives you more options than you had before.
