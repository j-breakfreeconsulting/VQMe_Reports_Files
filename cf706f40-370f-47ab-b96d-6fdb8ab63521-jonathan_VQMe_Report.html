      <p style="margin: 0 0 20px 0; font-size: 16px;">Jonathan,</p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You know what needs to happen. Network more strategically. Speak up in meetings. Share your wins. Build relationships with key influencers. Take on high-visibility projects.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        So why does it feel like you're working against yourself every time you try to build your reputation? Why does authentic self-promotion feel forced, or networking feel inauthentic, or putting yourself forward feel uncomfortable?
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        What if the problem isn't your strategy—it's that something in your thinking is working against you every time you try to step into the spotlight?
      </p>

        The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When you're operating from these strengths, you naturally stand for your principles while remaining open to other perspectives. You have the rare ability to be both steadfast in your values and genuinely accepting of others. You can deliver tough feedback with compassion and hold people accountable without being judgmental.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        These are exactly the qualities that build lasting, respected reputations. People trust leaders who have conviction but aren't rigid, who care about results but also care about people.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        But something's blocking access to these strengths when it comes to building your professional reputation.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>, which means you consistently underestimate the value you create and the difference you make. You think "anyone could do this" or "there's nothing special about what I do."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong>, creating a pattern where you don't fully recognize your own intrinsic worth. You judge yourself harshly and may even feel it's selfish to celebrate your unique gifts and talents.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Add <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, and you resist input from others about how to position yourself or build visibility—the very advice that could help you build the reputation you want.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The result? You stay in execution mode—head down, doing great work—but not stepping into the visibility and relationship-building that actually creates reputation.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Dissonance:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You have perfect clarity on having courage and conviction while balancing compassion and accountability, but your biases convince you that you don't make much difference and don't deserve recognition.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to help you stay humble and avoid seeming arrogant or self-serving. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> someone with a strong professional reputation, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Why Forcing Yourself Hasn't Created Lasting Change - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Most reputation-building advice focuses on actions: network more, share wins, speak up. But you can't sustain new actions without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current behavior.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You already know what you should do. But you don't do it. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That feeling—that emotion—is the step most people skip. They jump straight from knowing what to do to trying to force the action, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain it.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your thoughts create emotion (energy in motion). That emotion provides the energy to take action, which leads to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        So you try to force yourself. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your body is in one place while your head and your heart feel like they're in another. Ever felt that disconnect?
      </p>

             width="350" 
             style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When you're in a meeting or situation where you could build visibility, your brain immediately thinks: "What I'm doing isn't that special" or "I shouldn't put myself forward."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That thought creates emotions of discomfort, hesitation, or even guilt about self-promotion.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Those emotions drive actions like staying quiet, deflecting credit to others, or minimizing your contributions.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The result? You remain invisible while others with less capability but more confidence build the reputation you want.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for standing confidently in your values while remaining genuinely open to others—exactly what creates respected reputations.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Every time you minimize your contributions or stay invisible in key moments, you're not just missing opportunities. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of professional who does great work but doesn't get the recognition."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The friction isn't about your capability—it's about trying to build reputation through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to change your thoughts at the source. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with visibility opportunities throughout your professional day.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a professional who's "trying to get noticed" and become someone who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> stands confidently in your value.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Building reputation stops feeling like uncomfortable self-promotion and starts feeling like authentic leadership. The hesitation about stepping forward? It dissolves—not because circumstances changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You become the kind of professional who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> respect and recognition through genuine contribution instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">hoping</strong> someone will notice your hard work.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Where this leaves you
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        At this point, you've seen how certain thinking patterns tend to shape the emotions and actions that lead to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That awareness gives you more options than you had before.
