      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Have you tried adjusting your pricing strategy, analyzing your revenue streams more carefully, or researching what competitors charge—only to find yourself stuck in the same financial patterns? Have you tried pushing harder on profitability initiatives or investment decisions, but something feels off about the numbers you're seeing? 
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You know your business. You understand the market. You can see opportunities others miss. But when it comes to the money side—revenue growth, pricing decisions, investment choices—there's a disconnect between what you know should happen and what actually does.
      </p>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
          Why effort, discipline, or "trying harder" haven't produced the results you're aiming for

          How specific thoughts influence financial decisions, follow-through, and business outcomes
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When you're operating from these strengths, you're steadfast and principled. You can stand up for your ideas while remaining genuinely open to learning and growth. You have the capacity to be fair and accepting of different perspectives while maintaining high standards and accountability. These are the assets of someone who can make bold decisions and build trust simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        But something's blocking access to these strengths when it comes to your revenue growth and pricing decisions.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment (10-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Whatever You Are Doing (17-)</strong>, which means you're likely experiencing a significant gap between where you find yourself and where you think you should be. This creates a pattern where work feels more like obligation than opportunity—a means to an end rather than something intrinsically valuable.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeing Value in All You Do (24-)</strong>. These biases cause you to underestimate the value you create and the difference you make. You may think "anyone could do this" or feel like what you do isn't special enough to command premium pricing.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Understanding Consequences (24-)</strong> compounds this pattern. You may not fully see how underpricing or making financial decisions from this diminished sense of value creates long-term consequences for your business.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The result? You make financial decisions from a place of "I just want to get through this" rather than "I create significant value that deserves appropriate compensation."
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Dissonance:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You have perfect clarity on standing up for your convictions and balancing accountability with compassion, but your biases convince you that your work isn't special enough to price accordingly or that you should sacrifice profitability to avoid seeming greedy or demanding.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to help you stay humble and avoid appearing arrogant or self-serving. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> the kind of business owner who naturally creates sustainable revenue growth, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Why Forcing Yourself Hasn't Created Lasting Change - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Most business advice focuses on tactics—adjust your pricing, improve your sales process, find new revenue streams. But you can't sustain new financial behaviors without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current approach to money.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You already know what you should do. Charge what you're worth. Price for value, not just cost-plus. Make investment decisions based on potential returns, not fear. But you don't do it consistently. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That feeling—that emotion—is the step most people skip. They jump straight from knowing what to do to trying to force the action, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain it.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        So you try to force yourself. Set higher prices, then immediately offer discounts. Research investment opportunities, then find reasons to wait. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your business needs are in one place while your head and your heart feel like they're in another. Ever felt that disconnect?
      </p>

             alt="TEAR Model: Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results" 
             width="350" 
             style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When you're faced with a pricing decision or revenue opportunity, your brain immediately thinks: "This isn't that special—anyone could do this work."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That thought creates emotions of uncertainty and self-doubt.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Those emotions drive actions like underpricing, over-delivering to "prove" value, or avoiding financial conversations altogether.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The result? Revenue that doesn't reflect the actual value you create and investment decisions made from fear rather than strategic thinking.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for making courageous, principled financial decisions that balance accountability with compassion.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Every time you undervalue your work or avoid making bold financial decisions, you're not just leaving money on the table. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of business owner who doesn't charge what I'm worth because I'm not sure I'm worth it."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The friction isn't about your business acumen—it's about trying to grow revenue through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeing Value in All You Do (24-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to change your thoughts at the source. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with pricing decisions, investment opportunities, or revenue conversations throughout your day.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a business owner who's "trying to charge more" and become a business owner who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> prices for the value you create.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Revenue decisions stop feeling like internal battles about worth and start feeling like strategic choices based on value and market reality. The uncertainty that's been undermining your financial confidence? It dissolves—not because circumstances changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You become the kind of business owner who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> sustainable profitability instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">reacting</strong> to financial pressure with discounting and compromise.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Where this leaves you
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        At this point, you've seen how certain thinking patterns tend to shape the emotions and actions that lead to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That awareness gives you more options than you had before.
