      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Have you tried networking your way up the ladder, taking on more responsibilities, or developing new competencies to stay relevant—but found that the advancement you want keeps feeling just out of reach?
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Have you tried positioning yourself for leadership roles, only to discover that something about how you approach collaboration, feedback, or team dynamics doesn't quite land the way you intended?
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Have you tried learning new skills and demonstrating your value, but still feel like you're not making the difference or impact that would naturally lead to the recognition and advancement you're working toward?
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You're capable. You care about growth. You know what advancement requires. But there's a gap between your intentions and the results you're seeing.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        What this report promises to deliver

      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        As you read, you'll see:
      </p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 24px; margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: #333;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">Where friction shows up between what you want and what you keep doing</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">The thinking patterns that tend to support you when things are working</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">The patterns that tend to create tension, hesitation, or energy drain</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">Why effort, discipline, or "trying harder" haven't produced the results you're aiming for</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">How specific thoughts influence decisions, follow-through, and career outcomes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you're operating from these strengths, you're steadfast, confident, and accountable. You naturally know how to balance being true to your principles while remaining open to different perspectives. You can hold people responsible while treating them with fairness and respect.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        These are leadership assets. The exact cognitive strengths that create advancement opportunities.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        But something's blocking access to these strengths when it comes to career growth.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, which means you're highly resistant to being controlled or told what to do. You believe there's no one right way except perhaps yours.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Respecting Systems &amp; Authority (17-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>. Together, these create a pattern where you think there's always a better way than what existing systems offer, but you don't see your work as making much of a difference anyway.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Add <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Caring About Others (24-)</strong>, and the result becomes clear: You prefer not to get too involved with people, seeing relationships as potentially disruptive, while simultaneously resisting input from the very people who could influence your advancement.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? You stay focused on doing good work and developing competencies—but not building the collaborative relationships, seeking the feedback, or engaging with the systems that actually drive career advancement.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Dissonance:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You have perfect clarity on balancing compassion and accountability—the foundation of leadership—but your biases convince you that other people's input is controlling, systems don't apply to you, and getting involved with colleagues is disruptive.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to help you maintain independence and avoid being micromanaged or controlled. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> the kind of professional who naturally advances into leadership roles, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Why Trying Harder Keeps Backfiring - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Most people trying to advance focus on changing their actions—networking more, volunteering for projects, learning new skills. But you can't sustain new actions without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current approach.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You already know what career advancement requires. But you don't consistently do it. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That feeling—that emotion—is the step most people skip. They jump straight from knowing what to do to trying to force the action, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain it.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        So you try to force yourself to network, to seek feedback, to collaborate more effectively. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your body is in one place while your head and your heart feel like they're in another. Ever felt that disconnect?
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center; margin: 24px 0;">
        <img src="https://vqme-repository.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/TEAR+without+hard+lines_500x423.png" 
             alt="TEAR Model: Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results" 
             width="350" 
             style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you're in a situation that could advance your career—a networking event, a feedback conversation, a collaborative project—your brain immediately thinks: "They're trying to control me" or "This system doesn't make sense" or "I don't need their approval."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Those thoughts create emotions of resistance, disconnection, and frustration.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Those emotions drive actions like keeping conversations surface-level, avoiding follow-up, working independently even when collaboration would be more effective.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? You develop competencies and do good work, but miss the relational and political elements that actually drive advancement.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for leading with both conviction and compassion—exactly what organizations promote.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Every time you resist input that could help you grow, avoid the collaborative relationships that drive advancement, or dismiss the systems that determine promotions, you're not just missing career opportunities. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of professional who stays independent but wonders why advancement feels so difficult."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The friction isn't about your competence or work quality—it's about trying to advance through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Respecting Systems &amp; Authority (17-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Caring About Others (24-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to change your thoughts at the source. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with networking opportunities, feedback conversations, or collaborative decisions throughout your workday.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a professional who's "trying to advance" and become a leader who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> creates advancement opportunities.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Career growth stops feeling like playing politics you don't respect and starts feeling like authentic leadership that others want to follow. The resistance to feedback and collaboration? It dissolves—not because workplace systems changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You become the kind of professional who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> opportunities for mutual value instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">reacting</strong> to systems you wish were different.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Where this leaves you
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        At this point, you've seen how certain thinking patterns tend to shape the emotions and actions that lead to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That awareness gives you more options than you had before.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        What comes next is applying this in real career situations instead of letting it stay theoretical.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
