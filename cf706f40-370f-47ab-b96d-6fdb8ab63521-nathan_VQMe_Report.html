      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      You know the frustration of having solid business fundamentals but watching revenue growth stagnate. You understand your market, you deliver value, you know pricing should reflect that value—but something keeps interfering with the decisions that would actually move the needle on profitability.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      You've probably tried analyzing your numbers more thoroughly, researching pricing strategies, maybe even hiring consultants or attending workshops on revenue optimization. Yet the gap between knowing what needs to happen and consistently executing those high-value decisions remains.
      </p>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">The thinking patterns that tend to support you when things are working</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">The patterns that tend to create tension, hesitation, or energy drain</li>

      The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      When you're operating from these strengths, you naturally know how to stand by your values while remaining open to different perspectives. You can balance being understanding with holding yourself and others accountable. You have the capacity to make tough decisions while maintaining fairness and respect.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      But something's blocking access to these strengths when it comes to scaling revenue and improving profitability.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, which means you're highly resistant to input that feels controlling or limiting. You likely think: "There's no one right way to do things, except perhaps mine."
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeing Value in All You Do (24-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Understanding Consequences (24-)</strong>. This creates a pattern where you see your work as "a means to an end" rather than recognizing the full value you create, and you're "unaware of or uncaring about the negative consequences" of not optimizing systems and processes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Add in <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Whatever You Are Doing (17-)</strong>, and the result becomes clear: You stay busy doing work, but you avoid the strategic pricing conversations, investment decisions, and systematic revenue optimization that feels like "other people telling you what to do."
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      The Dissonance:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      You have perfect clarity on having courage to make tough decisions and balancing fairness with accountability, but your biases convince you that following proven revenue strategies means letting others control you, and that your current work approach is "good enough" without considering the long-term consequences to profitability.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to help you maintain independence and avoid failure through over-analysis. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> the kind of business owner who naturally creates sustainable, profitable growth, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      Why Trying Harder Keeps Backfiring - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Most business owners focus on changing their actions when revenue stagnates—they try new marketing tactics, adjust pricing randomly, or work longer hours. But you can't sustain new actions without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current approach.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      You already know what drives revenue growth. But you don't consistently do it. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      That feeling—that emotion—is the step most people skip. They jump from knowing what to do (raise prices, systematize sales, invest in growth) straight to trying to force the action, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain it.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      So you try to force yourself to be more strategic. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your body is executing tactics while your head and your heart feel like they're in another place entirely. Ever felt that disconnect in important revenue conversations?
      </p>

             alt="TEAR Model: Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results" 
             width="350" 
             style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      When you're facing a pricing decision or investment opportunity, your brain immediately thinks: "I shouldn't have to follow someone else's formula for this. I know my business better than any consultant or framework."
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      That thought creates emotions of resistance and self-sufficiency mixed with underlying doubt about whether what you're doing really matters.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Those emotions drive actions like avoiding systematic pricing strategies, researching endlessly without deciding, or defaulting to what's familiar rather than what's profitable.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      The result? Revenue growth that feels harder than it should be, with profitability that never quite matches the value you know you create.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for making courageous decisions that balance your values with market realities.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Every time you avoid strategic pricing conversations because they feel like "following someone else's rules," you're not just missing revenue opportunities. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of business owner who does things my own way, even when it costs me growth."
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      The friction isn't about your business acumen or market knowledge—it's about trying to grow revenue through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Understanding Consequences (24-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeing Value in All You Do (24-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to make tough pricing decisions with integrity and hold yourself accountable to profitable strategies. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with revenue decisions throughout your day.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a business owner who's "trying to be more strategic" and become a business owner who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> makes decisions that create profitable growth.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      Revenue conversations stop feeling like battles over control and start feeling like opportunities to create value with integrity. The resistance to proven strategies? It dissolves—not because you started following formulas, but because your thinking aligned with creating sustainable profitability.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      You become the kind of business owner who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> the conditions for profitable growth instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">reacting</strong> to market pressures with resistance.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      Where this leaves you
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      At this point, you've seen how certain thinking patterns tend to shape the emotions and actions that lead to your results.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      That awareness gives you more options than you had before.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      What comes next is applying this in real revenue decisions instead of letting it stay theoretical.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      What's next
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      If you want to apply what you just read instead of letting it fade into insight, here are two simple ways to continue.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      What Happens Next?
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
      You can let this sit as insight.<br>
      Or you can test whether it changes how you approach revenue growth.<br>
      Understanding this won't change your results. Using it might.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
      Option 1: Apply It Directly
      </p>
