      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You know the frustration of being capable, committed, and ready for the next level—but somehow still stuck where you are. You've likely tried leadership training, sought out mentors, maybe even worked with coaches. Each time thinking "this will be the thing that gets me recognized and promoted."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        But six months later, a year later, you're still in the same role, watching others advance while you wonder what you're missing.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—
        <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and 
        <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you're operating from these strengths, you're the leader people want to follow. You can stand firm on principles while being genuinely fair and understanding. You naturally balance tough love with flexibility. You have the capacity to be accountable for mistakes and realign with your values even when it's difficult.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        But something's blocking access to these leadership strengths when it comes to your career advancement.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, which means you unconsciously resist input that feels like control or coercion. Even when someone is trying to help you develop, part of you bristles at being told what to do.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment (10-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Whatever You Are Doing (17-)</strong>. These create a pattern where you feel trapped in your current role, going through the motions without joy or enthusiasm, waiting for "someday" when things will be different.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Add <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeing Value in All You Do (24-)</strong>, and you're operating from a mindset that what you're doing doesn't really matter—that anyone could do your job.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? You stay busy, productive, checking boxes—but not engaging in the high-visibility, value-creating activities that actually lead to recognition and advancement.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Dissonance:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You have perfect clarity on courage, conviction, and balanced leadership, but your biases convince you that your current situation is beyond your control and that your contributions don't really matter.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases likely developed as protective mechanisms to help you avoid disappointment and maintain independence in challenging environments. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> the kind of leader who naturally gets recognized for advancement, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Why Forcing Yourself Hasn't Created Lasting Change - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When most people try to advance their careers, they focus on changing their actions—networking more, speaking up in meetings, taking on bigger projects. But you can't sustain new actions without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current behavior.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You already know what you should do. Apply for that role. Volunteer for the high-stakes project. Have the conversation with your boss about your career goals. But you don't do it consistently. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That feeling—that emotion—is the step most people skip. They jump straight from knowing what to do to trying to force the action, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain it.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        So you try to force yourself to be more visible, more assertive, more strategic. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your body is going through the career development motions while your head and heart feel disconnected from the value of what you're doing.
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center; margin: 24px 0;">

             alt="TEAR Model: Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results" 
             width="500" 
             style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When an opportunity for visibility or advancement presents itself, your brain immediately thinks: "They're just going to tell me what they think I should do" or "This probably won't lead anywhere anyway."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That thought creates emotions of resistance, skepticism, and resignation.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Those emotions drive actions like half-hearted participation, avoiding stretch assignments, or staying safely in your lane.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? Another year passes without the recognition or advancement you want, reinforcing the story that your contributions don't really matter.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for courageous leadership and balanced accountability—the very qualities that would naturally attract recognition.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Every time you resist development feedback or avoid high-visibility opportunities, you're not just missing career advancement. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of professional who gets overlooked because what I do doesn't really matter."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The friction isn't about your leadership capability—it's about trying to advance your career through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice 10-</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment 10-</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference 17-</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction 100</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability 100</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to change your thoughts at the source. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with development opportunities, feedback conversations, and advancement decisions throughout your day.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary career development fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a professional who's "trying to get noticed" and become a leader who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> creates value that demands recognition.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Career advancement stops feeling like a political game you can't win and starts feeling like the natural result of aligned leadership. The resistance to feedback and development opportunities? It dissolves—not because the opportunities changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You become the kind of leader who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> the conditions for advancement instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">reacting</strong> to the frustration of being passed over.
      </p>
