        Have you tried analyzing your pricing model, studying your competition, and pushing harder on sales activities—only to find that revenue growth still feels like pushing a boulder uphill?
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Have you tried implementing new systems, following proven business frameworks, and seeking advice from mentors, but something still feels off about your approach to profitability?
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Have you tried everything you know to do, yet you're left with this nagging sense that you're missing something fundamental about why your revenue efforts aren't translating into the results you know are possible?
      </p>

        The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you're operating from these strengths, you're steadfast, committed, and confident. You can make tough decisions while staying true to your values. You naturally know how to balance understanding with accountability, creating trust with clients and partners. You have the capacity to be open to different perspectives without being defensive, and you can hold yourself and others responsible for results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        But something's blocking access to these strengths when it comes to growing revenue and increasing profitability.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, which means you're highly resistant to anything that feels like someone telling you what to do. Even when business mentors, consultants, or successful peers offer input on revenue strategies, your brain interprets it as an attempt to control or limit you.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment (10-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Whatever You Are Doing (17-)</strong>. These create a pattern where work feels like a means to an end rather than something inherently valuable. Combined with <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeing Value in All You Do (24-)</strong>, you're operating from a place where your business activities feel like obligations to get through rather than valuable contributions worth premium pricing.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Understanding Consequences (24-)</strong> means you tend to focus on immediate problems while ignoring longer-term impacts of your pricing and investment decisions. <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Caring About Others (24-)</strong> creates distance from truly understanding what your customers value, making it harder to price appropriately or identify growth opportunities.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? You make business decisions in isolation, resist proven systems that could accelerate growth, undervalue what you offer, and focus on getting tasks done rather than creating real value. All while knowing you should be growing revenue.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Dissonance:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You have perfect clarity on having courage and conviction in your values, but your biases convince you that input from others threatens your independence and that your work is just something to get through rather than something valuable to invest in and price appropriately.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to help you maintain autonomy in environments where authority felt controlling or work felt unfulfilling. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> the kind of business owner who naturally creates profitable growth, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>

        Why Forcing Yourself to Grow Revenue Hasn't Worked - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Most business advice focuses on changing your actions: better marketing, smarter pricing, more aggressive sales tactics. But you can't sustain new actions without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current approach.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You already know what you should do to grow revenue. But you don't do it consistently. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That feeling—that emotion—is the step most business owners skip. They jump straight from knowing what to do to trying to force the action, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain it.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The TEAR model explains why your revenue efforts feel like such a struggle:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        <strong style="font-weight: 600;">Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your thoughts create emotion (energy in motion). That emotion provides the energy to take action, which leads to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        So you try to force yourself to implement revenue strategies. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your body is executing business tasks while your head and your heart feel like they're somewhere else. Ever felt that disconnect?
      </p>

             style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you're considering raising your prices or investing in growth strategies, your brain immediately thinks: "I don't need someone else telling me how to run my business" or "This is just another thing I have to get through."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That thought creates emotions of resistance, resentment, or disconnection.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Those emotions drive actions like avoiding advice, underpricing your services, or treating revenue activities as boxes to check rather than value-creation opportunities.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The result? You stay busy with business activities but don't experience the profitable growth you want to recognize is possible.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for making confident decisions while remaining open to input that could accelerate your success.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Every time you resist input on revenue strategies or treat your business activities as obligations to endure, you're not just missing growth opportunities. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of business owner who has to figure everything out alone and doesn't get fulfillment from the work."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The friction isn't about your business capabilities—it's about trying to grow revenue through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Making a Difference (17-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to change your thoughts at the source. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with pricing decisions, investment choices, or growth opportunities throughout your business day.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary revenue bumps.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a business owner who's "trying to grow revenue" and become a business owner who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> creates profitable value.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Business growth stops feeling like something you have to force and starts feeling like the natural result of confident decision-making combined with genuine value creation. The resistance to input that's been limiting your growth? It dissolves—not because the advice changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        You become the kind of business owner who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> profitable relationships and sustainable revenue instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">reacting</strong> to market pressures and pricing fears.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #34495e; margin: 20px 0 10px 0; line-height: 1.3;">
        Where this leaves you
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        At this point, you've seen how certain thinking patterns tend to shape the emotions and actions that lead to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        That awareness gives you more options than you had before.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        What comes next is recognizing these patterns in real business situations instead of letting this stay theoretical.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.3;">

      <p style="margin: 0 0 14px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        If you want to apply what you just read instead of letting it fade into insight, here are two simple ways to continue.
