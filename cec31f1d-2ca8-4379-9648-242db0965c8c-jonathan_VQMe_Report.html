      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You know the frustration. You're capable, you have strong values, you know how to balance compassion with accountability in your leadership—but something keeps getting in the way of managing your time effectively. 
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The overwhelm persists. The priorities blur together. Work-life boundaries feel more like suggestions than actual lines. And no matter how many productivity tools or delegation strategies you try, the underlying tension remains.
      </p>

        The Real Issue: Your Brain is Working Against Itself
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your VQ assessment revealed something powerful: You have two incredible cognitive assets at complete clarity—<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When you're operating from these strengths, you're steadfast yet open, principled yet flexible. You naturally know how to hold people accountable while being understanding of their perspectives. You can stand up for what matters without being judgmental or defensive.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        But something's blocking access to these strengths when it comes to managing your time and setting boundaries.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Pattern Blocking You:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your profile shows <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, which means you're extremely resistant to being controlled or told what to do. Rules and systems feel restrictive rather than supportive. Combined with <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Respecting Systems &amp; Authority (17-)</strong>, you consistently look for shortcuts and better ways rather than following established processes.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You also show <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Seeking Fulfillment (10-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Whatever You Are Doing (17-)</strong>. These create a pattern where work feels like something you have to endure rather than something that energizes you. Your head is in one place while your body is somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Add <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Understanding Consequences (24-)</strong> and <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong>—you have an "out of sight, out of mind" attitude toward the mounting costs of poor boundaries, and you don't prioritize taking time for yourself because it feels selfish or unproductive.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The result? You reject the very systems and boundaries that could help you manage overwhelm, while simultaneously feeling trapped in work that doesn't fulfill you, all while sacrificing your own well-being in the process.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Dissonance:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You have perfect clarity on balancing compassion with accountability and staying true to your convictions, but your biases convince you that most time management systems are controlling restrictions rather than supportive structures.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        This isn't a character flaw. These cognitive biases developed for good reasons—likely as protective mechanisms to maintain your autonomy and prove your value through constant doing. They served a purpose. The question now is: are they still serving your goal of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">becoming</strong> the kind of leader who naturally creates sustainable boundaries and prioritizes what truly matters, or are they sabotaging it?
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Why Trying Harder Keeps Backfiring - The TEAR Model
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Most advice about time management and overwhelm focuses on systems, tools, and discipline. But you can't sustain new boundaries without addressing the thoughts and emotions driving your current behavior.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You already know what you should do—delegate more, say no to certain requests, protect your personal time. But you don't do it consistently. The reason? <strong style="font-weight: 600;">You don't feel like it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That feeling—that emotion—is the step most people skip. They jump straight from knowing what to do to trying to force better boundaries, completely bypassing the energy required to sustain them.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Thoughts → Emotion → Action → Results
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your thoughts create emotion (energy in motion). That emotion provides the energy to take action, which leads to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        So you try to force yourself to stick to priorities. And it works—for a while. But rarely consistently. Why? Forcing action without shifting the underlying thought pattern leaves you split: your body is setting a boundary while your head and your heart feel like you're being controlling or letting people down.
      </p>

             width="350" 
             style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">

      <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #5a6f82; margin: 28px 0 14px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Your Pattern in Action:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When someone asks you to take on another project or stay late, your brain immediately thinks: "These systems and expectations are trying to control me, but I have to prove I'm valuable through what I accomplish."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That thought creates emotions of resistance mixed with obligation and guilt.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Those emotions drive actions like saying yes when you mean no, working late to avoid conflict, or creating your own complicated systems instead of using proven ones.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The result? The overwhelm continues, boundaries remain fuzzy, and you're constantly trying to catch up on what actually matters.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Meanwhile, that pattern of biased thinking prevents you from accessing your incredible assets for creating the kind of principled, balanced approach to time and energy that would actually resolve the tension.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        The Cost of Continuing This Pattern
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        And this is where it gets expensive—not in dollars, but in who you're becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Every time you resist helpful systems because they feel controlling, you're not just staying overwhelmed. You're reinforcing an identity: "I'm the kind of leader who has to figure everything out alone and can't trust structures that might actually support me."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Every time you sacrifice your own well-being to prove your worth through constant doing, you're not just getting burned out. You're reinforcing: "I'm the kind of person who doesn't deserve the same consideration I give others."
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        The friction isn't about your leadership capability—it's about trying to manage time and boundaries through approaches that activate your biases (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Openness to Advice and Opinions (10-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Respecting Systems &amp; Authority (17-)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Enjoying Who You Are (24-)</strong>) instead of working with your cognitive strengths (<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Having Courage &amp; Conviction (100)</strong>, <strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-weight: 600;">Balancing Compassion &amp; Accountability (100)</strong>).
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Your cognitive assets give you the capacity to change your thoughts at the source. But understanding this pattern intellectually is very different from consistently shifting it in real-time when you're faced with requests, deadlines, and competing priorities throughout your day.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That's where guided application creates lasting transformation rather than temporary fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        What Changes When You Shift Your Thinking
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        When you learn to recognize your cognitive biases in real-time and shift to your assets before they derail you, something fundamental changes. You stop being a leader who's "trying to manage everything" and become a leader who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">naturally</strong> protects what matters most.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        Time management stops feeling like a constraint you have to fight and starts feeling like a tool that supports your values. The constant overwhelm and blurry boundaries? They dissolve—not because your workload changed, but because your thinking did.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        You become the kind of leader who <strong style="font-weight: 600;">creates</strong> sustainable systems and boundaries instead of <strong style="font-weight: 600;">reacting</strong> to the chaos that comes from avoiding them.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #1f3a5f; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; line-height: 1.35;">
        Where this leaves you
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        At this point, you've seen how certain thinking patterns tend to shape the emotions and actions that lead to your results.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 22px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
        That awareness gives you more options than you had before.
